# Examplez

whats the best way to play with value names/labels without losing information?

Mostly i just want to use the "value label" like yes/no rather than 0/1 i've been using  to_factor() but this seems to nuke the value names .

If you look in https://github.com/olanderb/Examplez/blob/main/2_Syntax/Examplez_workflow.R  I try to provide an example.

The dataset is fictious - feel free to use it.
